In the context of natural language processing a token could be a character or a word, but mind you that the concepts introduced here apply to all kinds of sequential data, such as e.g. protein sequences, weather measurements, audio signals, or videos, just to name a few.\n",

        "To really get a grasp of what is going on inside a recurrent neural network (RNN), we will carry out a substantial part of this exercise in NumPy rather than PyTorch. We start off with a simple toy problem, build an RNN using NumPy, train and it, and see for ourselves that it really works. Once we're convinced, we proceed to build and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell, also in NumPy. This is *not* simply to cause you frustration, but rather to provide you with a deeper understanding of the recurrence in RNNs, which will become very beneficial to you in the following weeks. Once you understand the inner workings of an RNN, we will proceed to a PyTorch implementation that you may use for the remainder of the course and in your projects.\n",
